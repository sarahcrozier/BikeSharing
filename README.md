## Summary
* The data indicates, that men who are subscribers use bike sharing before and after work hours. 
* The CitiBike usage may be attributed to an alternative to public transportation. 

## Reccomendations 
* Advertising and marketing should focus on male clients. Creating business partnerships that allow workers to commute via bike, could build cliental. 

* In lower use times offering reduced fares could increase ridership. 

* To expand the data to other cities, corralating public transportation data would be useful to see where current public transportation gaps may exist.
